    "# **Exploring a Multimodal Nutritional Data Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise provides a practical example of how a dataset from a real nutritional study could be analyzed and explored using basic statistical methods and machine learning approaches. The primary goal is to identify features that significantly influence an observed nutritional effect within the study. By applying these techniques, we aim to uncover the key factors that contribute to the outcomes, helping to enhance our understanding of nutritional impacts and guide future research. Specifically the small size of the dataset is a challenge here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we are analyzing is derived from a 2023 study titled \"Distinct Microbial Taxa Are Associated with LDL-Cholesterol Reduction after 12 Weeks of Lactobacillus plantarum Intake in Mild Hypercholesterolemia: Results of a Randomized Controlled Stud\" by MÃ¼ller et al. This research investigated the effects of probiotic bacteria on individuals with mildly elevated LDL cholesterol levels. Key data collected includes LDL cholesterol levels before and after the 12-week study period, along with various patient features recorded at the study's onset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analytical goal is to identify which key features might be linked to a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol. Data from the placebo group or from participants who left the study during execution have already been removed."

    "## Inferring Feature Importance by Utilizing a Random Forest\n",
    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a machine learning model that uses a series of decisions to split data into branches and leaves. At each node of the tree, a decision is made based on a feature, directing the data down the appropriate branch until a prediction is made at a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is straightforward and mimics human decision-making, making it easy to understand and interpret. However, decision trees can overfit if they grow too deep or complex, meaning they may not generalize well to new data. They are versatile for both classification and regression tasks but are often used within ensemble methods like Random Forest to enhance their accuracy and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "A Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning method that improves upon the simplicity of decision trees by creating a \"forest\" of them and aggregating their outputs. This model works by constructing multiple decision trees during training, each on a slightly different subset of the data and features. This technique, known as bootstrap aggregating or \"bagging,\" helps in reducing the model's variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When making predictions, a Random Forest takes the outputs from all the individual trees and combines them to produce a more accurate and stable prediction. For classification tasks, this typically means taking a majority vote among the predictions from all trees. For regression tasks, it usually involves averaging the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of a Random Forest lies in its ability to perform well on complex datasets with minimal tuning while avoiding overfitting, a common problem with individual decision trees. This robustness, combined with its straightforward interpretability (where the importance of features can be easily evaluated), makes Random Forest a popular choice for many predictive modeling tasks.

    "### Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature importance in a Random Forest provides insights into which features are most influential in making predictions. This method evaluates the impact of each feature on the accuracy of the model by observing how random alterations to feature values affect the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Random Forest, feature importance is typically measured by the average decrease in impurity (such as Gini impurity or entropy) across all trees in the forest when a feature is used to split the data. Alternatively, it can be assessed by examining the increase in prediction error when values of a feature are permuted, which disrupts the relationship between the feature and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps in identifying features that contribute significantly to the decision-making process of the model, allowing for better understanding and optimization of the model. Feature importance is valuable for feature selection, providing a way to remove irrelevant or less important features and potentially improve model performance.\n",

    "#### Splitting the Dataset into Training and Test Sets\n",
    "Before training our model, we must split the dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, allowing it to learn from the data. The test set, however, serves an unbiased role in evaluating the performance of the model. This separation helps in detecting overfitting and assessing the generalizability of the model to new, unseen data.\n",
    "**It's crucial to apply preprocessing steps to the training and test sets independently**. This approach prevents data leakage, where information from the test set inadvertently influences the model training process. \n",
    "#### Training the Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "With our data divided and preprocessed, we will proceed to train a Random Forest classifier. This model will use the training set to learn the patterns that correlate various dietary and health-related features with reductions in LDL cholesterol.\n",
    "After training, we will assess the performance of the model by calculating the loss on both the training set and the test set. This evaluation helps us understand how well the model has learned from the training data and how it performs on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extracting Feature Importance\n",
    "Finally, we will extract the feature importances determined by the Random Forest. These importances reveal which features have the most influence on predicting LDL cholesterol reduction. We will visualize these importances using a plot to easily identify the most significant features according to the model. This insight is valuable for understanding the driving factors behind LDL cholesterol reduction and could inform further research and decision-making.\n",

    "In this experiment, we systematically drop the least significant features from our model based on their importance scores to evaluate the impact on model performance. Starting with all features, we train the model, assess feature importance, and then remove the feature with the lowest importance score. This process is repeated, each time training the model with one fewer feature. This helps to establish a rank between the features. In the case of a usable model prediction, a sudden drop in model performance can also indicate an optimal number of features."

    "By repeatedly executing the experiment of dropping the least significant features and averaging their ranks across multiple iterations, we can establish a stable ranking of feature importance. This method involves training the model multiple times, each time removing a feature based on its assessed importance from the previous iteration and recording the rank at which each feature is dropped.\n",

Each feature's rank across different iterations is represented in a box plot, showing the median rank, the interquartile range, and any outliers.
